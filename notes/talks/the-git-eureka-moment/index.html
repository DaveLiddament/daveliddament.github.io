<br />
I have given this talk at [PHP Berkshire](https://www.meetup.com/PHP-Berkshire/events/241907235/), the whole event got 5 starts at time of submitting. Afterwards someone came up to me and said they too had had their git eureka moment!<br />
<br />
This will be a talk version of my git workshop that I&#039;ve now run 3 times (and I&#039;ve explained the same thing to numerous colleagues over the years).<br />
<br />
Feedback from previous times I&#039;ve run this talk/workshop: <br />
<br />
 * &quot;Great workshop, good pace and things were very well explained. Would definitely recommend&quot;<br />
 * &quot;Just used rebase for the first time at work - awesome! Cheers guys.&quot;<br />
