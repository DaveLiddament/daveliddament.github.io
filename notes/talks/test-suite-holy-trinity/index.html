            <p>What would the perfect test suite look like? Well it would definitely fully test every bit of functionality. It would run lightning fast. And the test suite would be quick to write. That sounds great right?</p>

<p>Unfortunately these 3 goals work against each other. Increasing test coverage will increase the time spent writing and executing tests. Reducing test execution time will result in lower coverage.</p>

<p>This talk look at the properties of unit, integration and system tests in terms of what they test, how fast they run and how quick they are to write. Will look at how to get the most out of testing at each of these levels, how best to architect code for testing and where best to make comprises.  Although by the end of the talk we won’t have quite achieved the Test Suite Holy Trinity, we’ll be a step closer.</p>

## Details<br />
<br />
This was my first ever conference talk at [PHP Benelux 2018](https://conference.phpbenelux.eu/2018/sessions/the-test-suite-holy-trinity/),<br />
it got [4 stars](https://joind.in/event/phpbenelux-conference-2018/the-test-suite-holy-trinity) on joind.in.<br />
[Slides](https://www.daveliddament.co.uk/talks/test-suite-holy-trinity-benelux.pdf)<br />
<br />
It has also been given at various UK meetups: PHPMInds, PHP North East, PHP Brighton.<br />
None of these had jonid.in, but a few tweets from these events included:<br />
<br />
- [&quot;Great talk from @DaveLiddament on testing and really interesting chat afterwards. I&#039;ve learnt things.&quot;](https://twitter.com/anna_hax/status/1007363812754907136)<br />
- [&quot;Already started applying the testing techniques I&#039;ve learnt from @DaveLiddament&#039;s talk yesterday at @BrightonPHP&quot;](https://twitter.com/TiborBesze/status/953381509318225922)<br />
<br />
<br />
There is no recording of this talk, but [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLltUzd10QQ) is a video of me from DPC last year.<br />
