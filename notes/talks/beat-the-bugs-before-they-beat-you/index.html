            <p>“In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.”</p>

<p>Software developers have a third certainty. Bugs.</p>

<p>Regardless of experience and skill level, all developers introduce bugs into their code. The longer these bugs fester, the more expensive the consequences of them become. So to improve the quality of our software we need to find bugs fast, ideally before they even end up entering the codebase.</p>

<p>This talk is aimed at beginner to intermediate level software developers. It introduces the  concepts: type hints, assertions and value objects.</p>

<p>We&#039;ll then look at how these techniques can be combined with modern IDEs to:</p>

<ul>
<li>reduce the chance of introducing bugs</li>
<li>minimising the cost associated with any bugs that do slip through the net</li>
<li>safely refactor code so we can rename classes, methods and variables to be more explicit</li>
</ul>

<p>This talk will leave you with plenty of tips on how to  write cleaner code with fewer bugs. And best of all you can apply them the next time you write code.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Earlier iterations of this talk were under the title &quot;<em>Is what you&#039;ve coded what you mean?</em>&quot;</p>

This talk has evolved over the past year. I&#039;ve given it 5 times in various guises and it&#039;s always received positive feedback. It&#039;s one of my favourite talks to give as it contains several takeaways that developers can apply next time they&#039;re coding. Beginner and intermediate developers will probably gain most from it.<br />
<br />
It started as a lightning talk given at PHP-SW. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJpvObzKewY), [Slides](https://www.daveliddament.co.uk/talks/dont-be-so-primitive.pdf). Feedback included this from Mayden Acadaemy (a PHP school) tweeted &quot;[Fantastic talk on value objects by @DaveLiddament, @MaydenAcademy can expect a curriculum update tomorrow!](https://twitter.com/MPOram/status/862379251395424256)&quot;<br />
<br />
I converted it to a full length talk called &quot;Is What You&#039;ve Coded What You Mean?&quot; [slides](https://www.daveliddament.co.uk/talks/is-what-youve-coded-what-you-mean-drupal.pdf). I presented it at PHP-Warks where it got [5 stars on joind.in](https://joind.in/event/php-warwickshire-june-2017-meetup/is-what-youve-coded-what-you-mean).<br />
<br />
It was also presented at Drupal Camp Bristol where it received [4 stars on joind.in](https://joind.in/event/drupalcamp-bristol-2017/is-what-youve-coded-what-you-mean). Including this comment: &quot;The content was confidently and clearly delivered, and points made followed a logical progression which I was able to follow. Well paced throughout. I&#039;m a big fan of seeing development principles demonstrated and explained using code samples. I took away a number of practical points and have an idea of areas where I can improve.&quot;<br />
<br />
There were many tweets too, including from Proctor + Stevenson &quot;[DaveLiddament providing our devs with some very valuable takeaways from his talk](https://twitter.com/ProctorsBristol/status/881098974530285570)&quot;<br />
<br />
It&#039;s current incarnation is &quot;Beat the bugs before they beat you&quot; [slides](https://www.daveliddament.co.uk/talks/beat-the-bugs.pdf). It&#039;s taken on feedback from DrupalCamp Bristol and PHPWarks. I&#039;ve presented it at PHP East Midlands where it received [5 starts on joind.in](5 starts on joind.in).<br />
