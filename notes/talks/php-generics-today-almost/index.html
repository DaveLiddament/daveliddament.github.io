            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>Ask PHP developers which big feature they wished PHP had and many would say generics.
Hopefully one day they&#039;ll be implemented at language level but what if we want them now?</p>

<p>This talk starts with a deep delve into generics and the benefits of them.
We&#039;ll then look at how existing static analysis tools can be configured to (almost) give us generics in PHP now.</p>

<p>This is a talk version of my article <a href="https://www.daveliddament.co.uk/articles/php-generics-today-almost/">PHP Generics today (almost)</a>.</p>
