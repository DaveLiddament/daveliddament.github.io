            <p>Have you ever wondered what it’s like to move from audience member to conference speaker? Is this a journey you want to make? In 2018, after 18 months of rejections, I finally got accepted for my first conference talk. In fact I got accepted for 6!</p>

<p>This talk charts the highs and lows of conference speaking and what it feels like the first time you take to the stage, all from the perspective of a novice conference speaker.</p>

<p>I&#039;ll share all the tips I picked up from other speakers and the things I learned the hard way. Armed with this knowledge hopefully your journey from first conference submission to first conference talk will be quicker than mine was.</p>

Have you ever wondered what it’s like to move from audience member to conference speaker? Is this a journey you want to make? In 2018, after 18 months of rejections, I finally got accepted for my first conference talk. In fact I got accepted for 6!<br />

                            <h3>Notes</h3>
                <br />
This is a talk I started writing after my first conference rejection email.<br />
<br />
It’s light hearted. It contains plenty of take aways (both mine and tips I’ve got from established speakers). And it ends on a positive note, encouraging those who want to, to apply. It’ll also list open CFPs.<br />
<br />
The message throughout is that anyone who wants to talk at a conference should submit.<br />
