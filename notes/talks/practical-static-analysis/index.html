<p>Modern static analysis tools (e.g. IDEs like PHPStorm and tools like Psalm, Phan and PHPStan) are far more advanced then their predecessors. They can find a whole range of bugs whilst keeping the false positive rate low.</p>

<p>This talk introduces more advanced static analysis. It will show the kinds of bugs that the more advanced static analysis tools can find. We&#039;ll then look how they can be added to your current development work flow. We&#039;ll finally look at how we can write our code in such a way to get the most out of static analysis.</p>

All developers know that bugs are bad and finding them can be difficult. The good news is tools to help us find and prevent bugs are becoming more powerful...<br />

                            <h3>Notes</h3>
                <br />
This talk has evolved both based on feedback received and as the tools I&#039;m talking about evolve. Recently it got [5 stars](https://joind.in/event/php-russia-2019/practical-advanced-static-analysis) at PHP Russian conference.<br />
In the week leading up to this conference I presented it at a local user group and got this nice tweet from Gary Hockin: [&quot;@DaveLiddament nailed it last night, any conference organisers should accept this talk pronto.&quot;](https://twitter.com/GeeH/status/1123574381228318720)<br />
