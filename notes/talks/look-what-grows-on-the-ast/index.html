            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>Have you heard the term Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and wondered what it is and where it is used?</p>

<p>First this talk explains what the AST is. It then looks at practical applications of it.</p>

<p>We will briefly look at how the AST is used by the PHP interpreter. 
The remainder of the talk examines how advanced static analysis tools (like <a href="https://psalm.dev/">Psalm</a> and <a href="https://phpstan.org/">PHPStan</a>) use the AST to find issues with code. 
Finally we&#039;ll see how to write our own static analysis rule.</p>

            <h3>Abstract (plain text)</h3>
            Have you heard the term Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and wondered what it is and where it is used?<br />
<br />
First this talk explains what the AST is. It then looks at practical applications of it.<br />
<br />
We will briefly look at how the AST is used by the PHP interpreter. <br />
The remainder of the talk examines how advanced static analysis tools (like [Psalm](https://psalm.dev/) and [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/)) use the AST to find issues with code. <br />
Finally we&#039;ll see how to write our own static analysis rule.<br />

                            <h3>Notes</h3>
                <br />
This is a new talk for 2020, so it&#039;s not been given yet. Here is an example of me speaking <br />
about static analysis at [PHP Russia](https://youtu.be/fNg3qGNUFYY), <br />
other examples are available from my [website](https://www.daveliddament.co.uk/talks)<br />
