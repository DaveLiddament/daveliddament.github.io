            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>There are so many benefits from code review; lower development costs, increased code quality, quick up-skilling and on-boarding of team members.  Despite these benefits many teams don’t have code review as part of their process at all. Others don’t get the gains they should from it.</p>

<p>This talk first outlines the business case for code review. It then explores how to make code review effective, specifically looking at:</p>

<ul>
<li>Expectations of what can be achieved with code review.</li>
<li>What should be covered by code review (including example code)</li>
<li>What should not be covered by code review</li>
<li>How to write code that makes code review easy</li>
<li>What makes good code review comments</li>
<li>What makes good responses to code review comments</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally to wrap up you&#039;ll be shown how to enable a code review  with Github. Spoiler alert: It can be done it under 5 mins!</p>

<p>So if you are on a team that isn’t using code review, or isn’t using it effectively then you should be at this talk.</p>

<br />
I&#039;ve given this talk at:<br />
<br />
- [CODEiD](http://codeid.com.ua/): [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAOW-mCIbsU). They didn&#039;t use joind.in, however a comment was left in their forum. See [comment on 14th Jan 2019 (used Google translate)](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ru&amp;u=https://dou.ua/forums/topic/26105/&amp;prev=search): &quot;I especially liked the report from Dave Liddament, as for me the most informative and clear&quot;.<br />
<br />
- PHPTek 2018: [5 stars on joind.in](https://joind.in/event/phptek-2018/effective-code-review) Including [this comment](https://joind.in/event/phptek-2018/effective-code-review#comment-88158c) &quot;This was definitely the best talk I&#039;ve attended so far this year. Very informative, lots of useful details mixed in with sufficiently high-level insights to be able to apply the lessons to my own work.&quot;<br />
<br />
- [phpday](https://2018.phpday.it/talks.html#dave-liddament): [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_-maGEY2Ck) [4 stars on joind.in](https://joind.in/event/phpday-2018/effective-code-review) and this from twitter about the phpday talk [&quot;@DaveLiddament’s talk is a good one! Those new to leading a team should go watch it, I found it very interesting.&quot;](https://twitter.com/J7mbo/status/1060936250398572544).<br />
